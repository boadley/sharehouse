### Contributing
__Step 1. Digitize material and convert to PDF__\
Snap a picture of the material (try to snap the picture in a way that you won't have to crop it later) or type it the pass question and convert the resulting files (PNG, JPEG, DOCX, or TXT you get the idea) to a PDF file using the trial version of [Nitropro](https://www.gonitro.com/) or [FoxitPDF](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/) (both software have very easy tutorials on how to collate multiple files into a single pdf file).

__Step 2. Rename the resulting PDF file__\
Rename the file according to the `Understanding the file names` section above.
