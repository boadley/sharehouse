# Project Sharehouse; the idea
Olabisi Onabanjo University Examination and Test (Continuous Assessment) Past Questions PDF.

```ruby
What if you can give all your textbooks, notebooks, past question papers, and other study materials to new students?
Would you share it, if it made others become better students?
```
Sometime in 2018, I found a guy who thinks the idea makes sense, together we collected a lot of past questions, notebooks, and other study materials from friends, then we proceeded to build a _centralized repository of studying material for Nigerian students_. We called the platform sharehouse (back in the day, it used to be popular; but the sustainability part didn't work out well. So we killed the program after we graduated in 2019 and decided to upload the files here). If you found this repo and you've past questions and you've got a heart of gold (I know you do). Please contribute yours too.

### Postscriptum
Even now, I'm still sold on the idea that _a centralized repository of study materials_, can improve the pass rate of university students in Nigeria.\

If this repo gets some activity (like stars and forks), I would build a nice frontend for searching the files in the repo.\
I hope you find this useful.
