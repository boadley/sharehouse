# Project Sharehouse
Olabisi Onabanjo University examination and test past questions pdf.

The open-source version of project sharehouse. This repo might look plain (and bloated :roll-eyes:) but there's a very interesting story behind this project. You can read the story on my blog [To share or not to share; the unsual story of projects sharehouse](https://blogboadleyfamily.rocks).

### Contributing
Okay, so you read the story and you want to share your past questions too? :yay-hands up: My heart melts. 
Check out this [contributing guide](https://github.com/#blah-blah-blah).
All contributions would be recognized. 

### Searching the Repo
Put a nice image (gif) here on how to search github single repo

### Understaning the file names
do a nice image explaining file names

```ruby
Programmes
    DEG = 
    CCED = 
    PG

Course Code
    TLM 308 = this changes sometimes

Course Title
    ... = well, u know what this means


```

### Postscriptum
If this repo gets some activity (like stars and forks), I would a build nice frontend for searching the files in the repo.
I hope you find this useful.
