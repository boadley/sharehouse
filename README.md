# Project Sharehouse
Olabisi Onabanjo University Examination and Test (Continuous Assessment) past questions pdf.

The open-source version of project sharehouse. Way back in circa 2018, my self and a friend had a problem; we had lots of examination past question papers (inherited from school fathers, senior and older friends). The way thing used to work is; once you have lots of past question, you either burn them or giver them to a mentee. Yea, you guessed right; this meant that some students had the precious past question, while some are left to practice for exams by reading textbooks. So I thought instaed of giving all my pass question to one mentee, why not give them to everybody. Luckily, I found a guy who thinks the idea makes sense, so together we collected a lot of pass wuation, notebooks and other study materials that students use studying, then we proceeded to buidl a centralised studying material repo for nigerian students. We called the platform sharehouse (back in the day, it used to be popular; so popularirty was shocking; but the sustainabily part didnt work out so well, so we killed the program after we graduated in 2019 and decided to upload the files here). If you found this repo and you;ve some pass questions and you've a gold heart (I know you do). Please contribyte yours too.
